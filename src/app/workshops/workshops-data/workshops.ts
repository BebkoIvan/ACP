                'For as long as I can remember, I’ve felt best around 4 p.m. Throughout the day, I’m alternately groggy, anxious, and distracted — but come late afternoon, my mood lifts, and I find the focus and calm that’s been eluding me.',

            fulltext: "It’s been this way throughout changes in my age, lifestyle, and schedule: as a teen getting a second wind in time for after-school soccer practice; as a college student hitting the library for a study sprint before dinner; as a full-time employee bemoaning the productivity kick that came too late in the workday; and today, as a freelancer, hitting my stride after a day of fits and start. You hear about morning people and night owls, but “afternoon people” seem to fly under the radar — in part because our chosen time of day isn’t exactly known for its benefits. The post-lunch energy dip is an infamous (and well-documented) workday menace. Some research suggests that we’re less motivated to seek out rewards in the afternoon. Experts do believe creativity tends to spike in the afternoon — but only because people are too depleted to maintain focus and are therefore more willing to let their minds wander. With everything else working against it, it’s no wonder that the afternoon is generally considered the best time to take a nap.And with most people claiming the morning or evening as their peak, it can be hard to know where we late-in-the-day bloomers fit in or how to structure our time accordingly. We might be a minority, but fortunately the workday is built to our advantage. If you feel your senses begin to sharpen around 3 p.m., just around the time when all your peers start dragging, then by all means, harness that energy. Just be deliberate about how you do it.First, though, it’s helpful to understand the basics of your circadian rhythm—the 24-hour internal body clock, ordered by the brain’s hypothalamus gland, that dictates your energy, mood, eating patterns, and sleep/wake cycle. As humans, we all more or less follow the same circadian cycle over the course of each day. In the morning, levels of cortisol, the hormone that boosts energy and increases stress, are generally higher, helping prepare the body to wake up. At night, the onset of darkness triggers the release of melatonin, the hormone that induces sleepiness, signaling to the body that it’s time for bed.But within this pattern are individual variations, known as chronotypes, that help explain why one person might easily leap out of bed at 6 a.m. while another prefers to burn the midnight oil. “There’s a genetic component to chronotypes. If your parents were morning people, you’re more likely to be a morning person,” explains Colleen McClung, PhD, a professor of psychiatry at the University of Pittsburgh’s Center for Neuroscience.Chronotype is also influenced by age, lifestyle, and environmental factors, especially light and darkness, she says. “Light at night will act to shift your circadian clock back because it suppresses melatonin,” McClung explains. “This is obviously a big problem nowadays, when people are often up late on their electronic devices.” Mealtimes also play a role: “If you’re eating late at night all the time,” she says, “that can shift your rhythms to being more of a night person.”            While it is possible to adjust your internal clock over the long term, doing so requires dedicated daily treatments, such as bright light and melatonin therapy, and adhering to a strict sleep-wake cycle, McClung says. And without a physician-guided plan, going against your natural chronotype can have harmful effects. For example, in McClung’s research, which focuses on the role of circadian rhythms in psychiatric disorders, she’s found that in people with bipolar disorder, one of the most common triggers for a manic episode is a change in sleep schedule. Even if you aren’t prone to depression or anxiety, circadian disruptions can induce chemical changes in the brain.",
